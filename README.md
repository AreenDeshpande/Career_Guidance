# Career Guidance System for Students

This project is designed to provide career guidance to students using a combination of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for frontend and backend, and Machine Learning recommender models to suggest suitable career paths based on student data and preferences.

## Project Overview

The Career Guidance System aims to help students make informed decisions about their career path by providing personalized suggestions. The platform collects data about students' skills, interests, and educational background to recommend suitable career options. 

The project will use:
- **MERN Stack**: 
  - **MongoDB** for database management
  - **Express.js** for building backend API
  - **React.js** for building the user interface
  - **Node.js** for the backend server
  
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Recommender models (e.g., Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, or Hybrid Models) to suggest personalized career paths based on student inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - React Router
  - Material UI (for UI components)

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (for database storage)

- **Machine Learning**:
  - Python (for building the recommender model)
  - Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (for ML model development)

- **Others**:
  - Axios (for making API requests from React to Node)
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
  - Passport.js (for user authentication)
  
## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and login functionality for students and admin users.
- **Student Profile**: Students can input their skills, interests, and educational background to create a profile.
- **Career Recommendations**: The platform will analyze the student's profile using ML models to suggest suitable career paths.
- **Admin Panel**: Admin users can manage student data and modify career recommendations if necessary.
- **Interactive UI**: Modern and responsive user interface to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Data Insights**: Admins can view aggregated insights about student preferences and career trends.
